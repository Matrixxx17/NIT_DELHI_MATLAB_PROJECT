## 🧩 Core Features

### ⚙️ 1. Real-Time Pose Detection (Computer Vision Pipeline)
At FitGuru’s core lies an advanced real-time pose detection system, powered by **Mediapipe** and **MATLAB**’s robust toolbox ecosystem.

#### 🧠 Technology Stack:
- **Computer Vision Toolbox** → Object Key Point Detection  
- **Deep Learning Toolbox** → Pre-trained models optimized for inference  
- **HDL Toolbox** → Hardware acceleration for low-latency (<100ms) tracking  
- **Signal Processing & MATLAB Mobile** → For seamless Android sensor integration  

#### 🎯 Functionality:
- Converts raw video feed into landmark coordinates  
- Detects reps, sets, form, and intensity with biomechanical accuracy  
- Outputs precise **performance metrics** for real-time evaluation  

---

### 📊 2. Performance Analysis & Diet Framing

FitGuru translates pose coordinates into **actionable health intelligence** using a **rule-based model** driven by biomechanics.

#### ⚙️ Process Flow:
- **Coordinate Input** → Pose landmarks from Feature 1  
- **Rule-Based Analysis** → Custom formulas detect reps, intensity, and form  
- **Diet Engine** → Automatically generates personalized diet recommendations  

The result is **data-driven nutrition guidance** that evolves based on workout type, duration, and recovery needs.
